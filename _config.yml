  Why become a data scientist with a PhD in philosophy?
  <br><br>
  Decision-making under uncertainty is something no one really enjoys, but it is an inevitable and frequent part of the human experience. We are pressed in high school to choose University or technical school (and which one?) without knowing completely the long-term consequences. We are asked in college to decide a major that could very well shape our career destiny in unforeseen ways. We choose a partner, whether to start a family, where to live, and so many other things without having all of the information, and these decisions can be HARD.

  But, data science and analytics can help, and that’s why I love it. Does it provide all the answers we seek? Of course not, but analyzing the data may offer otherwise unseen insight into a decision. Sometimes it reveals inherent errors in our judgment of a situation. Often it gives clarity to what we value as we examine possible targets for our algorithms. Almost always data science proves to be even more complex than imagined once in the weeds of a project...

  ...And this is where I live. As a philosopher, I breathe research and details. I never shy away from digging into the root of a problem - whether it is discovering which features are important to forecasting retail sales or extracting data from speech for numerous applications. My pulse increases as I launch into the unknown and challenge myself to reach further. I am a data scientist and ethicist who strives to improve the human experience, and I intend to stand in the gap as a bastion of integrity as we move into the age of artificial intelligence.
